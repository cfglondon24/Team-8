2. long sepsis / post sepsis syndrome, only 50% of adults who have sepsis are back in work in 1 year,
- loss of limbs, fatigue, psychological issues, memory loss, PTSD

scaling up online and face to face peer support groups .  also the carers, the families

emotional, human connection .  (chatbot?)
online self directed rehabilition , bring multimedia resources and track their process
user input data smart devices to understand good and bad recovery, red flags for repeated hospital admission

they want to track their progress, maybe even gameification - think of cognitive memory game

Pakistani descent are 3x more likely (think of using language?)

tiny charity - 3 support nurses

currently age accessed is: 44 - 64, but they want to access the very old and very young

care nurses currently bereavement experts, good at listening


is there scope to train new people to train people to be good listening ears and peer support volunteers?
- yes
-- add part of site is asking for volunteers and setting up a training system, very attractive idea
however, you have to remember people are vulnurable. one of the support nurses unfortunately 
fell to suicide. so you have to support the support listeners too.


diary tracking of recovery journey: physical cognitive psychological

physical - how are you feeling (survey) - nice dashboard tracking over time - input heart rate, step count from iot 
cognitive - memory game test (or just survey) - nice dashboard - 
psychological - how is your mood (survey) - nice dashboard


online groups are better attended than in person
